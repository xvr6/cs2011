# Procedures (aka Functions)

## Mechanisms in Functions

- Mechanisms all implemented with special machine instructions, and a set of conventions

### Passing control

- to beginning of function code
- back to return point
- Uses stack to support procedure call and return
- Function/Procedure call: `call label`
  - push *return address* on stack
  - jump to *label*
- Return address:
  - address of the next instruction immediately after call
- procedure return `ret`
  - pop return address from stack
  - jump to address

### Passing data

- function arguments
- return value

### Memory management

- Allocate during function execution
- Deallocate upon return
