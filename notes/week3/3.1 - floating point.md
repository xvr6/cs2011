# Floating Point

## Fractional Binary Numbers - deprecated

- bits to the right ofthe 'binary point' represent fractional powers of 2
- represents a rational number:
  - ![alt text](../img/3/fbnsum.png)
- ![alt text](../img/3/fbnex.png)
  - Divide by 2 by shifting right
  - Multiply by 2 by shifting left
  - numbers of form 0.1111.... are just below 1.0
    - 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... | 1/(2^i) -> 1.0
    - Use notation 1.0 - e 

### Limitations

- Repetition
  - Can only exactly represent numbers of the form x/(2^k)
  - Other rational numbers have repeating bit representations
  - ![alt text](../img/3/repetition.png)
- Precision
  - A large quantity of bits are necessary for very large or small numbers with fixed binary point
  - Numbers such as Planck's constant (-6.626068 x 10^(-34)) and Avogadro number (-6.022 x 10^(23)) were difficult to accurately represent
  
## What is a floating point?

- IEEE Standard 754
- A way to *approximate* real numbers in computers
  - Represents most rational numbers as well

### Numerical Form:

- ![alt text](../img/3/numericalform.png)
  - **Sign bit** s determines whether number is negative or positive
  - **Significand** M normally a fractional value in range [1.0, 2.0)
  - **Exponent** E weights value by power of two
- Encoding
  - MSB s is bit s
  - exp field encodes E (but is not equal to E)
  - frac field encodes M (but is not equal to M)
