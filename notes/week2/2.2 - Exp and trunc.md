# Expanding and Truncating

## Sign Extension

- Given a w-bit signed integer x
- Convert it to w+k-bit integer with the same value
- We do this by making k copies of the sign bit

  - Converting from smaller to larger integer data type
  - C automatically performs sign extension

## Sign truncation

- For unsigned numbers
  - equivalent to dividing by 2^k and keeping the remainder
  - trunc(x, k) = x mod 2^k
- For signed numbers
  - Same result, but the truncated numbers may have different signs
