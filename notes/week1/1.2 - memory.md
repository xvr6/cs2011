# Memory

- Pieces of an integer can bs spread out; they arent always directly next to each other in memory

## Endian

- 'Big Endian'
  - Least significant byte has *highest* address
- 'Little Endian'
  - Least significant byte has *lowest* address
- ![example](../img/1/endian.png)
  - Address given by `&x` is `0x100`
- Left side is little endian, right side is big endian:
